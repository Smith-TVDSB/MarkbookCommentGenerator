**Comment Generator Guide**

Do you want to save time on report card comments? Do you want to save more time than just using comment banks? Do you want to cut down on tracking each student&#39;s greatest strengths and next spot to review? If you said yes to any of these please continue:

In order to use this we have to do a little set up…

**Get the markbook file**

1. Log in to markbook web  
2. Select my classes  
3. From the left select the class you want to export  
4. Then select export class from the toolbar:  
5. Now you should have it downloaded, onto the next step…  

**Making the Expectations file**

1. Open the expectations template AND your markbook file.
2. Markbook has a big list of assessments from you under the Cell with [Marks] in it, to find this quickly press ctrl+F and look for marks
3. The assessment names will be in column B in this file. Copy the ones you want to use over into the expectations template file, you will want to overwrite my expectations.
4. Fill in expectations for each assessment beside the name. The generator will randomly pick one for you (you should have one for each assessment)
5. The expectations should flow in a specific format:
 &quot;Maggie has demonstrated considerable knowledge in {you expectation}…&quot;
 &quot;Mike should review {your expectation}&quot;
6. If you don&#39;t want to use NMs for areas of review then change the &quot;yes&quot; in Cell B1 to &quot;no&quot;
7. Once your satisfied with the number of assignments and expectations save it and you&#39;re ready to use the program!
